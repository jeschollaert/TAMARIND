### Introduction
The grand and imposing hard-wooded tree <span eid="Q80235">*Tamarindus indica* L.</span>, commonly known as the tamarind tree, has long been a contradictory plant: it is at once a place of refuge and site of danger, a medicinal purgative and a culinary shape-shifter, and a thirst-quencher that is drought tolerant. And while the tree has been documented across historical and literary genres for millenia, its place of origin remains scientifically obscure. Genetic studies do suggest an African origin, though wood charcoal analysis confirms that the tree has inhabited India since at least 1300 BC, leading some to argue it is indigenous to the region[^ref1]. The tamarind narrative is rooted in so many singular places, but its global circulation speaks to the plant’s long history and steadfast ability to grow in dry and hot climates. This sprawling but rooted mobility exemplifies the sturdy contradiction that is tamarind’s long history, which extends almost beyond the reaches of the earliest written records.

### A Tree of Many Names
From a taxonomic point of view, *T. indica*, first described as such by <span eid="Q1043">Carl Linnaeus</span> in <span eid="Q849308">*Species plantarum* (1753)</span> t1: 34, is considered the only species of the Tamarindus <span eid="Q34740">genus</span>. This has not always been the species’ name, however, as earlier scientific practitioners labeled the tree with taxonomic synonyms because they believed the genus to contain different species. Over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, *T. indica* acquired six synonyms, with *Tamarindus occidentalis Gaertn.*, or the “West Indian species,” recurring most often in the botanical literature. Comparably, the tamarind tree has garnered a host of colloquial names across the globe[^ref2]. In fact, *T. indica* derives from the Arabic *tamar-al-hindi*, or the date of India, so named after tamarind pulp’s date-like color and texture.

### The Tamarind's Locale 
The tamarind tree, a non-endangered semi-evergreen species, is easily recognizable for its beaded-necklace shaped pod and its pinnately lobed leaves that group to form a dense and bushy head of branches. As a member of the <span eid="Q44448">Fabaceae</span> family, it is best suited to the region between 23º26’N and 23º26’S, an area characterized by seasonal dry forest, tropical seasonal forest, and savanna biomes[^ref3]. These biomes’ climates feature slightly strong thermal oscillation and concentrated rains during specific parts of the year, resulting in water stress for plants during the dry season. Tamarind, therefore, is a drought-resistant tree with the capacity to grow in poorly developed soils through nitrogen fixation and endure aerosol salt from windy coastal areas.

Geographically, <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1934,5179,1968,1762">tamarind</span> can be found in 54 countries that lie within the plant’s historical circulation routes from Africa through the Middle East into India and down to Southeast Asia, as well as from Western European settler colonists who introduced the plant to South America and the West Indies. Today, India is the world’s largest tamarind producer. Orchards are located across the country, with one of the oldest groves, [Nallur Amarai](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/babur-to-wwii-to-sonia-gandhi-all-connected-through-the-tamarind-tree-in-india/247670/), located just outside of Begaluru. This 54-acre grove and recently-declared biodiversity heritage site is believed to have been planted during the <span eid="Q151148">Chola dynasty</span> in the 12th century, though the oldest dated tree is 400 years old.

### From Canopy to Pod: Tamarind’s Medicinal and Culinary Uses
Virtually every part of the tamarind tree—seeds, fruity pulp, bark, root, and leaves—is edible in some form. Tamarind fruit contains the rather unusual tantric acid that makes it simultaneously the “most acidic and sweetest fruit”[^ref4]. The acid’s sweet-sour flavoring makes it a valuable ingredient for a wide variety of dishes. Moreover, as French botanist <span eid="Q312959">Joseph de Tournefort</span> conjectured, the fruit’s acidity lends itself to uncountable medicinal uses, such as a [“purging medicine”](https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/detail/FOLGER~3~3~18513~281201:Receipt-book-of-Catherine-Bacon--ma), a [laxative](https://archive.org/details/b2130659x_0002/page/172/mode/2up?q=tamarind*), an [aid in facial paralysis](https://archive.org/details/englishtranslati00susruoft/page/n4/mode/1up?q=tamarind*), and a [flavoring to make more bitter or unpleasant medicines taste sweeter](https://archive.org/details/b2130659x_0002/page/172/mode/2up?q=tamarind*).  
<param ve-image region="-51,1682,4044,3528" label="Tamarindus indica, L., Jose Joaquim Freire, watercolor, 18th century" license="public domain" url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/%28Tamarindus_indica%2CL.%29.%2C_da_Cole%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Brasiliana_Iconogr%C3%A1fica.jpg">

Tamarind’s resilience has made it a central part of herbal medicine practices across history. The 17th-century oil painting created after French printmaker <span eid="Q16666497">Nicolas de Larmessin II</span> illustrates three men as the personifications of medicine, pharmacy, and surgery. At the center of the composition, the physician personifying medicine is cloaked in garb that bears the names of medieval authors central to traditional Western medicine, such as <span eid="Q8011">Avicenna</span> and <span eid="Q1291511">Mesue</span>, two Persian polymaths credited by Tournefort as key nodes in the spread of knowledge about tamarind. Taking a closer look at the center of the painting, just under beneath medicine man's hand, reveals a prescription document to treat medical ailments <span data-click-image-zoomto="366,572,344,300">prescription document</span>. Nestled among <span eid="Q162882">cassia</span> and <span eid="Q7535">rhubarb</span> is none other than tamarind.

In addition, tamarind is mentioned in traditional Sanskrit literature, incorporated in traditional African medicine, and, intriguingly, it appears in the <span eid="Q1995239">Susruta-Samhita</span>, an Ayurvedic medicine text. With such a diverse array of uses—and its hearty ability to withstand hot, dry climates—the plant captured the imagination of colonists on the hunt for profitable crops. The well-known synonym *T. occidentalis*, for example, was included in <span eid="Q4268924">Henry Perrine’s</span> 1838 report to the U.S. Congress House Committee on Agriculture, in which he includes *Tamarindus occidentalis* as a notable crop of value.

Tracing the appearance of the tamarind tree’s commonly-used parts across <span eid="Q1291275">materia medica</span>, travelogues, and cookbooks, as we do throughout, is one means to track the circulation of traditional herbal Ayurvedic medicinal knowledge through the peak of colonial expansion, call attention to the colonial economic interest in *T. indica*, and foreground the diverse religious and culinary cultures that the plant sustains.

### Leaves 
In its mature state, the tamarind tree’s vast crown is a place of refuge. Because the tree can grow in developed areas, be it the side of the road, in barren spaces, or in commercial areas, it’s a common gathering place for people seeking relief from hot sun or congregating for sacred reasons[^ref5]. In many cultures the tree has historically been considered holy. Tamil culture, for example, recognizes Puliyidaivalaiyamman as the tamarind <span eid="Q811571">tree deity</span> who offers fruit as a blessing. 
<param ve-image region="0,2603,8200,7343" label="Joseph Hooker's tamarind tree etching from his Himalayan Journal (1848)" author="Joseph Dalton Hooker" attribution="Wellcome Library Trust, https://wellcome.org" license="CC BY-NC 2.0" url="Hooker.jpg">

The leaves, young seedlings, and flowers that make up the crown are made into chutneys, added to sambar and soup, or used as the base for specific meals like the Indian dish chindar (Nagendra; Azad). Outside of the kitchen, the leaves, which contain tannins, [can be used as a dye](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S131961031100202X). [Saura tribal painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saura_painting#Paintings) is one tradition that makes use of the tamarind seed's natural brown hue to dye the background of paintings. In a medicinal context, the leaves can be dried or boiled for use as poultices to relieve swelling[^ref4].

### Seeds and Pods
While the tamarind seeds may not be as manipulable as the pulp (detailed below), they are just as valuable. When pilgrims flocked to the desert to meet Khorasan mystic poet and saint <span eid="Q1192519">Abu Said</span>, they paid good sums to obtain seeds from the tamarind tree he sat beneath (Dole & Walker XXIX). Tamarind seeds are also worthy of eating: after they are soaked to remove the seed coat, they can be roasted, boiled, fried, or ground (Nagendra; Azad). In Thailand, the ground seeds are used as a coffee substitute (Morton). In Ayurvedic medicine, the shells of the tamarind pods can be burned to create an “alkaline ash” to then be used in other recipes (Dutt 1870). In addition to its culinary uses, the seeds can be made into a tamarind kernel powder and used in the textile and paper industry (de Caluew 54).

### Pulp
Tamarind pulp makes up roughly 30-50% of a ripe fruit (de Caluwe 57). The pods are picked at various stages in the fruits’ life cycle for different flavor profiles. The sour fruit from immature pods is incorporated into pickles and chutneys, or used to season rice, fish, and meat. The mature but unripe fruit can be eaten in food or independently, such as in the Bahamas where the pods are roasted on coals until the skins burst and the hot pulp is eaten coated in wood ashes (Morton). The ripe mature pod, which contains a sweet-sour brown pulp, is used as a seasoning for sauces, curries, desserts, and drinks (Nagendra; Azad; Caluwé et al.).

One immensely popular refreshing drink sold everywhere from restaurants to markets—tamarind water—is made when pulp is added to water and sweetened. The Mexican soft drink brand Jarritos sells a tamarind-flavored option and a quick Youtube search reveals dozens of how-to videos for making these beverages at home.
<param ve-video id="pXtKAmhKdpI">
      
Tamarind water has been around since at least the late medieval period as an enjoyable beverage—and also a medicinal drink. <span eid="Q6101">Marco Polo</span>, in his travel accounts, observes merchants being “force[d]...to swallow a stuff called Tamarindi, mixed in sea-water” that results in “violent purging” (2nd ed., ii. 383.). A few centuries later, <span eid="Q256288">John Parkinson</span>, apothecary to <span eid="Q79972">James I</span> and Royal Botanist to <span eid="Q81506">Charles I</span>, writes of tamarind in his *Theatrum botanicum* (1640): “it doth exceedingly helpe to assuage the thirst, if an ounce there-of be dissolved in faire water, and a little Sugar mixed therewith.” Parkinson notes that the drink is a particularly suitable thirst-quencher for “people of the hot countries.”

Similarly, Mrs. A.C. Carmichael, a Scottish migrant to the British West Indies and wife of enslaver <span eid="Q4215366">John Wilson Carmichael</span>, points out in *Domestic manners and social condition of the white, coloured, and Negro population of the West Indies* (1834) that the tamarind beverage is drank in ever-increasing quantities as settler-colonists spend more time in the tropics, resulting in more “relaxed constitution[s].” Carmichael is appalled when her own alimentary desires follow this shift: “During the first year I resided in <span eid="Q379656">St. Vincent</span>, I never felt thirst between breakfast and dinner, unless I had walked or rode out during the heat of the day; but before I left the West Indies, I felt a great change in this respect, taking sometimes as many as six or seven large glasses of water in the forenoon. Upon the whole, indeed, the dangers of climate seem pretty nearly balanced between Great Britain and the West Indies: imprudent exposure to cold is dangerous in Britain, and the same exposure to heat is dangerous in the West Indies.” [NEED A FINAL SENTENCE HERE].

### Cooking & Empire: Tamarind Recipes
During or following their [time/stay] in the British colonies, white women colonists like Mrs. Carmichael would often feature tamarind in English-language colonial cookbooks. Examples like Flora Steel and Grace Gardiner’s 1909 *The complete Indian housekeeper & cook: the duties of mistress and servants, the management of the house, and practical recipes for cooking in all its branches* is dedicated “To the English girls to whom fate may assign the task of being house-mothers in our Eastern Empire” (##). Here, culinary knowledge of tamarind is weaponized by British colonists to help train “fate[d]” future women to better work in service of empire.

       src="https://archive.org/embed/b21528640/page/158/">

But just as tamarind has been a tool of empire in colonial kitchens, it’s also been used by the people displaced by colonial regimes as an avenue to create community. Hawa Hassan and Julia Turshen’s cookbook [*In Bibi’s Kitchen: The Recipes and Stories of Grandmothers From the Eight African Countries that Touch the Indian Ocean*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-bibis-kitchen-the-recipes-stories-of-grandmothers-from-the-eight-african-countries-that-touch-the-indian-ocean/oclc/1136960226&referer=library_profile&returnRegistryId=105808) (2020) features elder women’s recipes through the lens of their larger communities. The South African section most prominently features tamarind, highlighting the culinary traditions of the <span eid="Q1276753">Cape Malay people</span> who are [descendants of enslaved Muslims](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/cape-malay-cuisine-south-africa/index.html) forcibly brought to South Africa by the Dutch East India Co. The grandmothers share a recipe for “Denningvleis,” a sweet and sour lamb stew. [Final sentence here?].

### Conclusion
Tamil writer <span eid="Q2893448">Sundara Ramaswamy’s</span> recently-translated 1966 novel [*Oru Puliyamarathin Kadai*, (Tamarind History)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/tamarind-history/oclc/891509442&referer=brief_results) begins “There is no road that does not end at the base of the tamarind tree.” Described in [one review](https://www.thebookreviewindia.org/living-and-dying/) as a <span eid="Q188602">sthala purana</span> (place-legend or narrative of a place), the novel’s opening pages describe one village’s lone but vibrant tamarind tree alongside its various human-projected monikers -- silent witness, self-reliant, mother-tree, beacon of dignity -- before informing the reader that it was destroyed. As a narrative of the tamarind tree’s “living and dying”, the novel depicts the tamarind as both an ancient witness to and active participant in human movements, reminiscent of the tree’s uses in spreading and growing pods that quench thirst even in the driest of environments. The tamarind continues to be a sturdy contradiction, offering relief on the hottest of days, even into the present, as we continue to learn from the plant’s many complexities.
