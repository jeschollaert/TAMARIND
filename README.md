### Introduction
The grand and imposing hard-wooded tree <span eid="Q80235">*Tamarindus indica* L.</span>, commonly known as the tamarind tree, has long been a contradictory plant: it is at once a place of refuge and site of danger, a medicinal purgative and a culinary shape-shifter, and a thirst-quencher that is drought tolerant. And while the tree has been documented across historical and literary genres for millennia, its place of origin remains scientifically obscure. Genetic studies do suggest an African origin, though wood charcoal analysis confirms that the tree has inhabited India since at least 1300 BC, leading some to argue it is indigenous to the region.[^ref1] The tamarind narrative is rooted in so many singular places, but its global circulation speaks to the plant’s long history and steadfast ability to grow in dry and hot climates. This sprawling but rooted mobility exemplifies the sturdy contradiction that is tamarind’s long history, which extends almost beyond the reaches of the earliest written records.

Such contradictions have been explored through storytelling: the tree serves as creative inspiration, thematic motif, and simple set dressing across myth, legend, and fiction.[^ref2] The tamarind got its small leaves, per a <span eid="Q1165">Bihar</span> tribal story, when the exiled <span eid="Q160213">Lord Rama</span>, <span eid="Q917687">Lakshmana</span> and <span eid="Q191114">Sita</span> came upon a tamarind grove, where the tree’s large leaves provided shelter. But Rama was convinced that they were to suffer during their exile and so he ordered Lakshmana to shoot at the leaves with his bow and arrow—the leaves have been split ever since.[^ref3] And though many cultures venerate the tree as sacred or home to gods, other stories urport the tree’s curses and dangers; some Indian and Caribbean communities warn that the tamarind is home to spirits. A <span eid="Q9089">Hindu</span> legend illustrates how the tree became cursed: one day, Radha, goddess of love and compassion, was on her way to meet <span eid="Q42891">Krishna</span> when she stepped on a piece of ripe tamarind fruit bark and cut her foot. Now late for her meeting with the god, she cursed the fruit to fall from the tree still unripe, as it does today.[^ref4] The sheer pervasiveness of the plant in visual, oral, and written cultures across the globe speaks to its mythological status as both sprawling and rooted, exemplifying the sturdy contradiction that is the tamarind tree.

### A Tree of Many Names
From a taxonomic point of view, *T. indica*, first described as such by <span eid="Q1043">Carl Linnaeus</span> in <span eid="Q849308">*Species plantarum* (1753)</span> t1: 34, is considered the only species of the Tamarindus <span eid="Q34740">genus</span>. This has not always been the species’ name, however, as earlier scientific practitioners labeled the tree with taxonomic synonyms because they believed the genus to contain different species. Over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, *T. indica* acquired six synonyms, with *Tamarindus occidentalis Gaertn.*, or the “West Indian species,” recurring most often in the botanical literature. Comparably, the tamarind tree has garnered a host of colloquial names across the globe.[^ref5] In fact, *T. indica* derives from the Arabic *tamar-al-hindi*, or the date of India, so named after tamarind pulp’s date-like color and texture (the name also bears a resemblance to the Ethiopian vernacular for tamarind, *tommar*).

### The Tamarind's Locale 
The tamarind tree, a non-endangered semi-evergreen fast-growing species, is easily recognizable for its beaded-necklace shaped pod and its pinnately lobed leaves that group to form a dense and bushy head of branches. It is best suited to the region between 23º26’N and 23º26’S, an area characterized by seasonal dry forest, tropical seasonal forest, and savanna biomes.[^ref6] These biomes’ climates feature slightly strong thermal oscillation and concentrated rains during specific parts of the year, resulting in water stress for plants during the dry season. Tamarind, therefore, is a drought-resistant tree with the capacity to grow in poorly developed soils through nitrogen fixation, a feature shared by all species from the <span eid="Q44448">Fabaceae</span> family, and endure aerosol salt from windy coastal areas. For all the above reasons, there is no wonder why tamarind can be found in 54 countries along the plant’s historical circulation routes. In the Sahelian region and many other parts of Africa, however, tamarind fruits collected from ‘natural’ populations or from individual trees that have been preserved, encouraged or planted, are essential components of the non-monetised ‘hidden harvest’ of wild resources, for which assessment of their economic importance requires estimating how much local populations would have to pay to replace these ‘free’ resources.[^ref1] Currently, tamarind can be considered a life-vest for future generations since it has a tremendous potential in sequestering carbon, and acts as an enhancer of agroforestry for small farmers and landless labourers in semi-arid areas in danger of desertification.

Regarding India, the world’s largest tamarind producer, some sources suggest that tamarind was introduced in this region (and then spread to Southeast Asia) from Central Africa by Arab trade groups over land and sea. It is more likely, however, that Ethiopian merchants who traded with India centuries before the Arabs, brought the plant to India via sea routes, keeping the long-lasting and nutritious tamarind pulp on board ships for food and drink . It is well-documented that the Arabs, perhaps after seeing tamarind thrive in India, traded the plant back to the Middle East and Europe.[^ref7] From Europe, the plant moved west with Spanish and Portuguese settlers, who transported it to Central and South America and the West Indies.

Today, tamarind orchards are located across India, with one of the oldest groves, [Nallur Amarai](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/babur-to-wwii-to-sonia-gandhi-all-connected-through-the-tamarind-tree-in-india/247670/), located just outside of Begaluru. This 54-acre grove and recently-declared biodiversity heritage site is believed to have been planted during the <span eid="Q151148">Chola dynasty</span> in the 12th century, though the oldest dated tree is 400 years old. While the plant has been cultivated in orchards like this one and grown as a large-scale crop for commercial purposes, the trees are most frequently referenced in historical literature as singular trees, in small groups as ornaments, or populating roadsides.

This is the case for the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1934,5179,1968,1762">tamarind trees</span> featured in the lavishly illustrated late 16th-century manuscript, *History of Babur* (*Tuzk-e Babri*), which details the life of <span eid="Q797848">Emperor Babur</span> (1483-1530), founder of the <span eid="Q33296">Mughal</span> dynasty. One of the first autobiographies in Islamic literature, the text was originally written in the Chagatai language and later translated to Persian for this manuscript at the behest of Babur’s grandson, Emperor Akbar, so that his political and military exploits might be further circulated. The finely-detailed tamarind tree illustration seen here is described as a “very good-looking tree, giving dense shade” that “grows wild in masses,” a depiction supported by the groves of tamarind trees that are referenced throughout Babur’s travels.[^ref14]

### From Canopy to Pod: Tamarind’s Medicinal and Culinary Uses
Virtually every part of the tamarind tree—seeds, fruity pulp, bark, root, and leaves—is edible in some form. Tamarind fruit contains the rather unusual tantric acid that makes it simultaneously the “most acidic and sweetest fruit”.[^ref8] The acid’s sweet-sour flavoring makes it a valuable ingredient for a wide variety of dishes. Moreover, as French botanist <span eid="Q312959">Joseph de Tournefort</span> conjectured, the fruit’s acidity lends itself to uncountable medicinal uses, such as a [“purging medicine”](https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/detail/FOLGER~3~3~18513~281201:Receipt-book-of-Catherine-Bacon--ma), a [laxative](https://archive.org/details/b2130659x_0002/page/172/mode/2up?q=tamarind*), an [aid in facial paralysis](https://archive.org/details/englishtranslati00susruoft/page/n4/mode/1up?q=tamarind*), and a [flavoring to make more bitter or unpleasant medicines taste sweeter](https://archive.org/details/b2130659x_0002/page/172/mode/2up?q=tamarind*).  
<param ve-image region="-51,1682,4044,3528" label="Tamarindus indica, L., Jose Joaquim Freire, watercolor, 18th century" license="public domain" url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/%28Tamarindus_indica%2CL.%29.%2C_da_Cole%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Brasiliana_Iconogr%C3%A1fica.jpg">

Tamarind’s resilience has made it a central part of herbal medicine practices across history. The 17th-century oil painting created after French printmaker <span eid="Q16666497">Nicolas de Larmessin II</span> illustrates three men as the personifications of medicine, pharmacy, and surgery. At the center of the composition, the physician personifying medicine is cloaked in garb that bears the names of medieval authors central to traditional Western medicine, such as <span eid="Q8011">Avicenna</span> and <span eid="Q1291511">Mesue</span>, two Persian polymaths credited by Tournefort as key nodes in the spread of knowledge about tamarind. Taking a closer look at the center of the painting, just beneath the medicine man's hand, reveals a <span data-click-image-zoomto="366,572,344,300">prescription document</span> to treat medical ailments . Nestled among <span eid="Q162882">cassia</span> and <span eid="Q7535">rhubarb</span> is none other than tamarind.

In addition, tamarind is mentioned in traditional Sanskrit literature, incorporated in traditional African medicine, and, intriguingly, it appears in the <span eid="Q1995239">Susruta-Samhita</span>, an Ayurvedic medicine text. With such a diverse array of uses—and its hearty ability to withstand hot, dry climates—the plant captured the imagination of colonists on the hunt for profitable crops. The well-known synonym *T. occidentalis*, for example, was included in <span eid="Q4268924">Henry Perrine’s</span> 1838 report to the U.S. Congress House Committee on Agriculture, in which he includes *Tamarindus occidentalis* as a notable crop of value.

Tracing the appearance of the tamarind tree’s commonly-used parts across <span eid="Q1291275">materia medica</span>, travelogues, and cookbooks, as we do throughout, is one means to track the circulation of traditional herbal Ayurvedic medicinal knowledge through the peak of colonial expansion, call attention to the colonial economic interest in *T. indica*, and foreground the diverse religious and culinary cultures that the plant sustains.

### Leaves 
In its mature state, the tamarind tree’s vast crown is a place of refuge. Because the tree can grow in developed areas, be it the side of the road, in barren spaces, or in commercial areas, it’s a common gathering place for people seeking relief from hot sun or congregating for sacred reasons.[^ref9] In many cultures the tree has historically been considered holy. Tamil culture, for example, recognizes Puliyidaivalaiyamman as the tamarind <span eid="Q811571">tree deity</span> who offers fruit as a blessing.[^ref10]

The leaves, young seedlings, and flowers that make up the crown are made into chutneys, added to sambar and soup, or used as the base for specific meals like the Indian dish chindar.[^ref5][^ref6] Outside of the kitchen, the leaves, which contain tannins, [can be used as a dye](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S131961031100202X). [Saura tribal painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saura_painting#Paintings) is one tradition that makes use of the tamarind seed's natural brown hue to dye the background of paintings. In a medicinal context, the leaves can be dried or boiled for use as poultices to relieve swelling.[^ref8]

### Seeds and Pods
While the tamarind seeds may not be as manipulable as the pulp (detailed below), they are just as valuable. When pilgrims flocked to the desert to meet Khorasan mystic poet and saint <span eid="Q1192519">Abu Said</span>, they paid good sums to obtain seeds from the tamarind tree he sat beneath.[^ref11] Tamarind seeds are also worthy of eating: after they are soaked to remove the seed coat, they can be roasted, boiled, fried, or ground.[^ref5][^ref9] In Thailand, the ground seeds are used as a coffee substitute.[^ref12] In Ayurvedic medicine, the shells of the tamarind pods can be burned to create an “alkaline ash” to then be used in other recipes.[^ref13] In addition to its culinary uses, the seeds can be made into a tamarind kernel powder and used in the textile and paper industry.[^ref8] In terms of seed viability, they retain their germination capability for several months if kept dry. Also, seeds can be scarified or briefly boiled to enhance germination[^ref15].

### Pulp
Tamarind pulp makes up roughly 30-50% of a ripe fruit.[^ref8] The pods are picked at various stages in the fruits’ life cycle for different flavor profiles. The sour fruit from immature pods is incorporated into pickles and chutneys, or used to season rice, fish, and meat. The mature but unripe fruit can be eaten in food or independently, such as in the Bahamas where the pods are roasted on coals until the skins burst and the hot pulp is eaten coated in wood ashes.[^ref12] The ripe mature pod, which contains a sweet-sour brown pulp, is used as a seasoning for sauces, curries, desserts, and drinks.[^ref5][^ref8][^ref9]

One immensely popular refreshing drink sold everywhere from restaurants to markets—tamarind water—is made when pulp is added to water and sweetened. The Mexican soft drink brand Jarritos sells a tamarind-flavored option and a quick Youtube search reveals dozens of how-to videos for making these beverages at home.
<param ve-video id="pXtKAmhKdpI">
      
Tamarind water has been around since at least the late medieval period as an enjoyable beverage—and also a medicinal drink. <span eid="Q6101">Marco Polo</span>, in his travel accounts, observes merchants being “force[d]...to swallow a stuff called Tamarindi, mixed in sea-water” that results in “violent purging” (2nd ed., ii. 383.). A few centuries later, <span eid="Q256288">John Parkinson</span>, apothecary to <span eid="Q79972">James I</span> and Royal Botanist to <span eid="Q81506">Charles I</span>, writes of tamarind in his *Theatrum botanicum* (1640): “it doth exceedingly helpe to assuage the thirst, if an ounce there-of be dissolved in faire water, and a little Sugar mixed therewith.” Parkinson notes that the drink is a particularly suitable thirst-quencher for “people of the hot countries.”

Similarly, Mrs. A.C. Carmichael, a Scottish migrant to the British West Indies and wife of enslaver <span eid="Q4215366">John Wilson Carmichael</span>, points out in *Domestic manners and social condition of the white, coloured, and Negro population of the West Indies* (1834) that the tamarind beverage is drank in ever-increasing quantities as settler-colonists spend more time in the tropics, resulting in more “relaxed constitution[s].” Carmichael is appalled when her own alimentary desires follow this shift: “During the first year I resided in <span eid="Q379656">St. Vincent</span>, I never felt thirst between breakfast and dinner, unless I had walked or rode out during the heat of the day; but before I left the West Indies, I felt a great change in this respect, taking sometimes as many as six or seven large glasses of water in the forenoon. Upon the whole, indeed, the dangers of climate seem pretty nearly balanced between Great Britain and the West Indies: imprudent exposure to cold is dangerous in Britain, and the same exposure to heat is dangerous in the West Indies.” Both Carmichael and Parkinson's commentary expressly connects ingesting tamarind water to hot climates, and the people who occupy those areas. In this way, the two actively perpetuated a centuries-long discourse linking climate, health, and race as a means of colonial control and exploitation.

### Cooking & Empire: Tamarind Recipes
During or following their time in the British colonies, white women colonists like Mrs. Carmichael would often feature tamarind in English-language colonial cookbooks. Examples like Flora Steel and Grace Gardiner’s 1909 *The complete Indian housekeeper & cook: the duties of mistress and servants, the management of the house, and practical recipes for cooking in all its branches* is dedicated “To the English girls to whom fate may assign the task of being house-mothers in our Eastern Empire.” In the chapter “Hints to Missionaries and Others Living in Camp and Jungles,” the authors instruct readers to use tamarind water to quench their thirst in the course of their missionary work, when such work takes them away from established towns and villages. The authors refer to tamarind using the Hindi term “Imli,” suggesting that their knowledge of the plant comes either directly or indirectly from those speaking Hindi. The cookbook does not offer any insight as to how the British women gained access to the tamarind itself -- there are no instructions for harvesting the pods from the trees, or even directions about how best to acquire the plant from a market. This suggests that tamarind was so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable -- its acquisition is not worth mentioning, because it is so common and readily available. Here, British women circulate knowledge about Indian cuisine best suited to help British women unused to the climate survive, so as to help train “fate[d]” future women to better work as missionaries in service of empire. A recipe for tamarind water is also featured in Henrietta Hervey’s 1895 [*Anglo-Indian Cookery at Home: A Short Treatise for Returned Exiles*](https://archive.org/details/b28047898/page/n47/mode/2up). Hervey, “the wife of a retired Indian officer,” as she describes herself, includes tamarind or tamarind water in at least twenty-one recipes, though she notes in her preface that she does not use vernacular terms as she “endeavor[s] to adapt my instructions to the conditions ruling here,” addressing her English audience. Interestingly, while Hervey advises her readers to have tamarind available for the recipes in her book, she also does not feel the need to address any potential roadblocks or obstacles for British women in England seeking tamarind, which again suggests that tamarind’s availability is so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable. Hervey’s cookbook is not marketed like Steel and Gardner’s, which is more of an instruction manual for British women embarking for India to help in missionary or government work; instead, Hervey aims to meet the desires of those officers and their wives who have returned from colonial governance in India and find themselves missing the the flavors and dishes they had grown once accustomed to, or, to use Hervey’s words, “fleshpots of the land of their exile.”

But just as tamarind has been present in colonial kitchens, it’s also been used by the people displaced by colonial regimes as an avenue to create community. Hawa Hassan and Julia Turshen’s cookbook [*In Bibi’s Kitchen: The Recipes and Stories of Grandmothers From the Eight African Countries that Touch the Indian Ocean*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-bibis-kitchen-the-recipes-stories-of-grandmothers-from-the-eight-african-countries-that-touch-the-indian-ocean/oclc/1136960226&referer=library_profile&returnRegistryId=105808) (2020) features elder women’s recipes through the lens of their larger communities. The South African section most prominently features tamarind, highlighting the culinary traditions of the <span eid="Q1276753">Cape Malay people</span> who are [descendants of enslaved Muslims](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/cape-malay-cuisine-south-africa/index.html) forcibly brought to South Africa by the Dutch East India Co. The grandmothers share a recipe for “Denningvleis,” a sweet and sour lamb stew. Hassan and Turshen are clear in the introduction to their cookbook that their text is made with care and respect, a text made outside of the white male gaze that has dominated so much of tamarind's determined value on a global market since the height of empire. Instead, Hassan and Turshen take pride in the everyday home cooking of the elder women they interview and feature in their book, the everyday cooking that utilized tamarind before, despite, and after European colonization. This endurance of the everyday is an apt setting in which to emphasize the tamarind, an eminently useful plant and an often delightful treat.

### The Story of a Tamarind Tree
Tamil writer <span eid="Q2893448">Sundara Ramaswamy’s</span> recently-translated 1966 novel [*Oru Puliyamarathin Kadai*, (Tamarind History)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/tamarind-history/oclc/891509442&referer=brief_results) begins “There is no road that does not end at the base of the tamarind tree.” Described in [one review](https://www.thebookreviewindia.org/living-and-dying/) as a <span eid="Q188602">sthala purana</span> (place-legend or narrative of a place), the novel’s opening pages describe one village’s lone but vibrant tamarind tree alongside its various human-projected monikers -- silent witness, self-reliant, mother-tree, beacon of dignity -- before informing the reader that it was destroyed. As a narrative of the tamarind tree’s “living and dying”, the novel depicts the tamarind as both an ancient witness to and active participant in human movements, reminiscent of the tree’s uses in spreading and growing pods that quench thirst even in the driest of environments. Tamarind’s steady presence in storytelling, from ancient myths to the postmodern novel, is a testament to the plant’s enduring uses as a foodstuff as well as a source of meaning. But tamarind can also be the material on which stories are written. In his important text, [*The materia medica of the Hindus*](https://archive.org/details/b21934113/page/40/mode/2up), Uday Chand Dutt describes accounts of how some of the manuscripts he referenced to compile his own text were made from tamarind-seed emulsions. Tamarind-seed emulsions were used to make paper, and the emulsion helped create a surface for easy writing. Perhaps it is no surprise that such an eminently useful plant would help inspire stories as well as serve the purpose of recording narratives, recipes, and histories of which it so often played an important, if ubiquitous, role. The tamarind continues to be a sturdy contradiction, offering relief on the hottest of days, even into the present, as we continue to learn from the plant’s many complexities.
