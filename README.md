# Taxonomy 
Tamarindus indica L., commonly known as Tamarind, is a grand and imposing hard-wooded tree belonging to the Fabaceae family. Easy recognizable for its beaded-necklace shaped pod and its pinnately lobed leaves that group forming a dense and bushy head of branches, this species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his work Species plantarum (1753) t1: 34. Its origin, nonetheless, remains a mystery: genetic studies point out towards Africa but it has been documented to inhabit India for many centuries —there is evidence of a wood charcoal analysis from around 1300 BC (Nagendra)—.

From a taxonomic point of view, T. indica is considered the only species of the Tamarindus genus, though throughout history has been named by other synonyms which were believed to be different species. The concept of a taxonomic synonym refers to a name, which is not accepted, applying to the same taxon as the accepted name. In this particular case, synonyms are not accepted due to rejection of a classification represented by the synonym. <!--infographic hyperlink--> T. indica has six synonyms attached to the accepted name, being the most recurrent in the literature Tamarindus occidentalis Gaertn., which we can see referring to the “West Indian species”. The other synonyms are Tamarindus umbrosa Salisb., Tamarindus officinalis Hook., Tamarindus somalensis Mattei, and Tamarindus erythraeus Mattei.

# Appearance of Tree 

This semi-evergreen species finds its vital requirements between 23º26’N and 23º26’S in the seasonal dry forests, the tropical seasonal forests and the savannas. The climate of this biome <!-- infographic hyperlink zonobiome II according to Walter’s classification--> is characterized by a slightly strong thermal oscillation and concentrated rains during a concrete period of the year, which implies a certain water stress for plants during the dry season. Tamarind, therefore, is a drought-resistant tree with the capacity to grow in poorly developed soils —it is able to fixate nitrogen itself into the soil—  and endure aerosol salt from the wind coming from coastal areas.

While the Tamarindus indica can be found in 54 countries, India is the world’s largest producer. Tamarind orchards are located across the country, with one of the oldest groves, Nallur Amarai, located just outside of Begaluru. This 54-acre grove and recently-declared biodiversity heritage site is believed to have been planted during the Chola dynasty in the twelfth century, though the oldest dated tree is 400 years old. Though widely cultivated in India, it remains underexploited and unimproved in Africa (Fandohan et al.) . Later on, it was also introduced in South America and the Antilles along the XVI-XVII century with the Spanish and Portuguese settlers.

# Tamarind's Uses -- Food and Medicine 

Many parts of the tamarind tree—fruit, leaves, seeds, and bark—are edible in some form. <!--piecemeal through tree? OR image visualization -- different zooms --> Tamarind appears in various materia medica for its medicinal uses. Beyond its use as a drink to quench thirst, it is described as a “purging medicine,” (Bacon 1680s-1739), a laxative (Stephenson 1834), an aid in facial paralysis (Susruta transl. Bhishagratna 1907-1916) , and its role in making other more bitter or unpleasant medicines taste sweeter (Stephenson 1834).

# Pulp --> Tamarind Water 
In Latin America,  for instance, the pulp is sweetened with sugar and added to water to create agua de tamarindo, a popular refreshing drink sold everywhere from restaurants to markets. Tamarind water, as both an enjoyable food and a medicinal drink, has been around at least since the late medieval period. In his Travel Account (1298), Marco Polo observes merchants being “force[d]...to swallow a stuff called Tamarindi, mixed in sea-water” that results in “violent purging” (2nd ed., ii. 383.) 

In the early modern period, John Parkinson, apothecary to James I and Royal Botanist to Charles I, writes of tamarind in his Theatrum botanicum (1640): “it doth exceedingly helpe to a[ss]uage the thir[s]t, if an ounce there-of be di[ss]olved in faire water, and a little Sugar mixed therewith.” Parkinson notes that the drink is a particularly suitable thirst-quencher for “people of the hot countries.”

Similarly, Mrs. A.C Carmichael, a Scottish migrant to the British West Indies and wife of slave-owner John Wilson Carmichael, points out in Domestic manners and social condition of the white, coloured, and Negro population of the West Indies (1834) that the tamarind beverage is drank in ever-increasing quantities as settler-colonists spend more time in the tropics, resulting in more “relaxed constitution[s].” Carmichael is appalled when her own alimentary desires follow this shift: “During the first year I resided in St. Vincent, I never felt thirst between breakfast and dinner, unless I had walked or rode out during the heat of the day; but before I left the West Indies, I felt a great change in this respect, taking sometimes as many as six or seven large glasses of water in the forenoon. Upon the whole, indeed, the dangers of climate seem pretty nearly balanced between Great Britain and the West Indies: imprudent exposure to cold is dangerous in Britain, and the same exposure to heat is dangerous in the West Indies

# Seeds / Pods / Shells 
The seeds can be eaten after they are soaked to remove the seed coat. They can then be roasted, boiled, fried, or ground (Nagendra; Azad).  In Thailand, the ground seeds are used as a coffee substitute (Morton). In Ayurvedic medicine, the shells of the tamarind pods can be burned to create an “alkaline ash” to then be used in other recipes (Dutt 1870).  

<!--POD PIC--> 

The pods are picked at various stages in the fruits’ life cycle. The sour fruit from immature pods is incorporated into pickles and chutneys, or used to season rice, fish, and meat. The mature but unripe fruit can be eaten in food or independently, such as in the Bahamas where the pods are roasted on coals until the skins burst and the hot pulp is eaten coated in wood ashes (Morton). The ripe mature pod, which contains a sweet-sour brown pulp, is used as a seasoning for sauces, curries, desserts, and drinks (Nagendra; Azad; Caluwé et al.). 

# Leaves 
The leaves (along with young seedlings and the flowers) are made into chutneys, added to sambar and soup, or used as the base for specific meals like the Indian dish chindar (Nagendra; Azad). Its vast crown gives the so needed shade in these latitudes and makes it perfect to gather around it. So, no wonder why in some cultures it has historically been considered a holy tree.  On the other hand, this multipurpose species has no specific threats so that it is currently classified in the Least Concern category of the IUCN Red List (iucnredlist.org).
